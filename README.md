# HTML-Practice
In this session I was using the basic HTML tags and attributes to create a basic HTML page that included
1. Unordered list
2. Ordered list
3. Page breaks
4. Lines
5. Images
6. Hyperlink
7. Bold text

### Getting started with HTML
HTML, which stands for Hyper Text Markup Language, is one of the fundamental building blocks of the web. When you visit a webpage, your browser reads HTML and renders the document on the page. HTML is primarily responsible for holding the content of a page; the styling is defined by CSS, and much of the interactivity is controlled by JavaScript (we'll get to these technologies soon enough)

### The Structure of HTML
If you've never seen HTML before, one of the first things you'll notice is probably the number of elements, which are the building blocks of HTML. We specify the name of the element using its name along with opening and closing brackets (<>). To denote the ending of a tag, we use </>. 

To bring up the basic structure of the HTML page, type in the ! and press enter and it should come up automatically.

Notice that sometimes elements are nested inside of other elements. meta and title are inside of head, h1 is inside of body, and everything is inside of html. These are commonly referred to in the language of parents and children: we say that the h1 element is a child of the body element, for example, and that the body element is the parent of the h1 element. Elements with the same parent are called siblings; the meta and title tags are siblings in the document above.
In fact, you can think of the entire structure of an HTML document in terms of these relationships. From this perspective, the document looks like a tree, with parent nodes higher up on the tree, and child nodes down below.
