# HTML-Practice
In this session I was using the basic HTML tags and attributes to create a basic HTML page that included
1. Unordered list
2. Ordered list
3. Page breaks
4. Lines
5. Images
6. Hyperlink
7. Bold text

### Getting started with HTML
HTML, which stands for Hyper Text Markup Language, is one of the fundamental building blocks of the web. When you visit a webpage, your browser reads HTML and renders the document on the page. HTML is primarily responsible for holding the content of a page; the styling is defined by CSS, and much of the interactivity is controlled by JavaScript (we'll get to these technologies soon enough)

### The Structure of HTML
If you've never seen HTML before, one of the first things you'll notice is probably the number of elements, which are the building blocks of HTML. We specify the name of the element using its name along with opening and closing brackets (<>). To denote the ending of a tag, we use </>. Here's a basic HTML
document:

<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
<head>
  <meta charset="UTF-8">
  <title>My first HTML page!</title>
</head>
<body>
  <h1>Here's some important text!</h1>
  <div>Here's some content.</div>
  <div>See ya later!</div>
</body>
</html>

To bring up the basic structure of the HTML page, type in the ! and press enter and it should come up automatically.
